## TODO:
- Pass team payload to teamDetail page (display team title / id on detail).

- Components for recent files, commits, issues.

## QUESTIONS / COMMENTS:
- I was having a little trouble pulling in the `App.less` styles from inside `views - Teams - Teams.js`. I would have rather not made _everything_ a components & view and instead imported needed components into views.

- My first time using Less. Thanks for the introductory, definitely will use in future projects.

- Is there a way to unhash the compiled CSS during development? It would be nice to have this feature while using DevTools to check styles.

- Ran into some complications passing data (`team.id`) to the child component (_teamsDetail.js_).

- **Personal assessment**: Building out the UI was very straightforward. The bulk of development time was spent structuring the app and researching `react-router-dom`. Overall, it was very fun using this tech stack.
